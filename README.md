# CPP-n-Qt-projects
C++ &amp; Qt projects. Use them freely

Most of them I wrote while studying at uni (2018-2022).
* "Qt" folder contains qt-relative projects.
* "ModernOpenGL" was my opengl sandbox. There are some shaders for 3D, lighting ect.
* "neuro_img_gen" is a project I created to generate noisy/shifted images for NN training.
